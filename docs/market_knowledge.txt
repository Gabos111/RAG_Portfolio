**Title:** Sharpe Ratio

**Section:** Risk-Adjusted Returns

**Keywords:** Sharpe Ratio, Risk-Adjusted Return, Investment Performance

**Summary:** Explains the concept of the Sharpe Ratio and its importance in evaluating investment performance.

**Content:**

The **Sharpe Ratio** is a measure of risk-adjusted return, calculated as:

\[
\text{Sharpe Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_f}{\sigma_p}
\]

where:

- \( R_p \) = Portfolio Return
- \( R_f \) = Risk-Free Rate
- \( \sigma_p \) = Portfolio Standard Deviation (Volatility)

It helps investors understand the return generated per unit of risk taken. A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted performance.

**Title:** Portfolio Beta

**Section:** Risk Metrics

**Keywords:** Beta, Market Sensitivity, Systematic Risk

**Summary:** Explains how portfolio beta measures sensitivity to market movements.

**Content:**

**Portfolio Beta** indicates the sensitivity of the portfolio's returns relative to a benchmark index. It's calculated as:

**Title:** Maximum Drawdown

**Section:** Risk Metrics

**Keywords:** Maximum Drawdown, Peak-to-Trough Decline, Risk Measurement

**Summary:** Defines maximum drawdown and its significance in risk assessment.

**Content:**

**Maximum Drawdown** is the largest percentage drop from a portfolio's peak value to its lowest point before a new peak is achieved. It measures the most significant loss an investor could have experienced during a specific period.

Calculation:

\[
\text{Max Drawdown} = \min \left( \frac{C_t}{\text{Rolling Max}_t} - 1 \right)
\]

where:

- \( C_t \) = Cumulative Return at time \( t \)
- \( \text{Rolling Max}_t \) = Maximum Cumulative Return up to time \( t \)

Understanding max drawdown helps investors gauge potential downside risk.

The **Information Ratio (IR)** measures the risk-adjusted return of a portfolio relative to a benchmark index.

Calculation:

\[
\text{Information Ratio} = \frac{R_p - R_b}{\sigma_{(R_p - R_b)}}
\]

where:

- \( R_p \) = Portfolio Return
- \( R_b \) = Benchmark Return
- \( \sigma_{(R_p - R_b)} \) = Standard Deviation of the Active Return (Tracking Error)

A higher IR indicates better consistency in outperforming the benchmark.
