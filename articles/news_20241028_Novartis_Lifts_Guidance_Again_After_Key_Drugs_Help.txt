content: Novartis raised its full-year guidance for the third time this year after higher third-quarter profit and sales topped analystsâ€™ expectations, boosted by revenue from its key drugs. The Swiss pharmaceutical giant said Tuesday that it now expects its core operating profit - one of its preferred metrics, which strips out exceptional items - to grow by a high-teens percentage in 2024 compared with its previous target of growth in the mid- to high-teens range. Novartis now forecasts full-year sales growth to be in the low double digits, having previously guided for high-single to low-double-digit growth.
