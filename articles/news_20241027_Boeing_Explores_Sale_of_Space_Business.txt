content: Boeing helped put the first men on the moon. Now it wants to get out of the space race. The beleaguered company is exploring a sale of its storied NASA business, including the troubled Starliner space vehicle and operations that support the International Space Station, according to people familiar with the matter. The effort, part of a strategy by Boeingâ€™s new Chief Executive Officer Kelly Ortberg to streamline the company and stem its financial losses, is at an early stage and might not result in a deal. Boeing faces a deepening financial crisis. Its largest labor union has rejected two contract proposals and extended a strike that has halted most of its airplane production.
