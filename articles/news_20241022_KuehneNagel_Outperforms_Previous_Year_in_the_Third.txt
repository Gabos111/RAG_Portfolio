content: In the third quarter, the logistics group Kuehne+Nagel increased its turnover compared to the same period last year. There was stronger demand for flexible logistics services, not least due to renewed supply chain disruptions, the company explained. Net sales increased by 19 per cent to CHF 6.49 billion and gross profit adjusted for volatile freight rates rose by 5 per cent to CHF 2.19 billion, as the company announced on Wednesday. As a result, the profit figures also improved.
