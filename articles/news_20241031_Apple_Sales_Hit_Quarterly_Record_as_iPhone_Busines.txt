content: Apple reported record revenue for the September quarter, propelled by a modest rebound in iPhone sales that came ahead of its release of new AI tools. For Appleâ€™s fiscal fourth quarter, total sales were $94.9 billion, beating the $94.5 billion analysts were expecting, according to FactSet. Net income fell around 35% to $14.7 billion due to a judicial ruling in Europe that will force Apple to pay more than $14 billion in taxes to Ireland.
