content: Tesla reported surprisingly strong earnings in the third quarter, helping the electric-car maker to regain momentum after a tumultuous start to the year in which its profit fell for two straight quarters. Net income was $2.2 billion for the July-to-September period, a 17% increase from a year earlier and lifted in large part by higher sales of regulatory credits to other automakers and the strength of Tesla’s energy business. Global deliveries also rose in the third quarter, helping to boost revenue by 8% to $25.2 billion. Tesla’s stock was up 12% in after-hours trading Wednesday, following the earnings release and call. Musk confirmed Wednesday Tesla has abandoned plans for a long-awaited $25,000 electric car.
