content: Meta Platforms reported record revenue despite slower digital advertising growth, bolstering profits that helped fund billions in artificial intelligence and augmented reality investments. The company posted $40.59 billion in sales, an all-time high that slightly beat Wall Street expectations. The revenue growth of 19% compared with the year-earlier period was slower than the 22% growth in the three months ended in June. Advertising made up 96% of Meta’s third-quarter revenue. Mark Zuckerberg, Meta’s chief executive, has poured immense resources into capitalizing on the AI boom, increasing spending to support ambitions that include having the most-used AI assistant in the world.
